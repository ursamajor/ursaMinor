# Okay, here's how this works!
# There are two types of rules: native rules and list-based rules.
#
# Native rules are written in Ruby and will not be in the YAML file.
# I'm including snippets of what they could be. They're in Python
# simply because I'm not fluent in Ruby yet. They should be in Ruby.
# Hopefully we will need less than a dozen native rules.
#
# List-based rules contain boolean logic. These exist to reduce the
# amount of code that needs to be written. In addition, the bulk of
# rules will be list-based, for easier management.
#
# The outermost nesting has the rule-args syntax because 
# we can only have one outermost filter and I think that's the 
# standard way to do it.
#
# Native rules will be loaded before list-based rules. Native rules
# and list-based rules are treated the same after they are loaded.
# In YAML, rules can be referred to as "$rule_name".
